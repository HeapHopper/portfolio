*“Only today, sir - code at rock-bottom prices!”* the merchants called out to me. *“A selection of lines in any language you want! In any development environment! Buy a kilo of code lines - get two, a limited time offer!”*

The situation I’m describing sounds ridiculous, and it truly is ridiculous. But have you ever wondered why? The first thing we learn when we enter the high-tech world is to code. Conditions and loops, functions and classes, utilize memory and runtime matters. So if the code is truly great - who wouldn’t want to buy it by weight?

The reason is that code… was never the product. **A programmer’s job is not to produce code but to produce a solution**.

Your code can be top-notch - no one’s impressed. What value does it provide? Does it make someone’s life easier? Does it enable an entrepreneur to fulfill their dream?

And if these things were true before, now with GenAI and co-pilots, they are even more so. Because those whose job is to produce code – it’s natural and even understandable that they would worry about the rise of AI. But those whose job is to deliver solutions - they welcome every new capability of these tools, because they make their work not only easier, but possible in ways never before imaginable.”
